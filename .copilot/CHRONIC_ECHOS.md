# Chronic Echos - Design Document
## Overview
"Chronic Echos" is a 16-bit RPG for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) that combines classic turn-based combat with innovative time-manipulation mechanics. Players will embark on a journey through different eras, solving puzzles and battling enemies while altering the flow of time to influence events and outcomes. The key feature of the game is the ability to create "time echoes" of the player character, allowing for unique strategies in both exploration and combat. Classes, Jobs, and special abilities will be influenced by the era the player is currently in, adding depth and variety to gameplay.

Chronic Echos is an ambitious late-90s-style SNES game that combines elements from classic RPGs like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy V, and Breath of Fire. The game's core mechanic revolves around time manipulation, offering a unique twist on traditional turn-based combat and exploration.

## Story
In a world where time is fractured, a young hero named Arin discovers an ancient artifact known as the Chrono Crystal. This crystal grants the ability to manipulate time, allowing Arin to travel between the past, present, and future. As Arin journeys through various timelines, they must prevent a catastrophic event that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality itself. Along the way, Arin will encounter allies and enemies from different eras, each with their own motivations and stories. The choices made by the player will influence the outcome of the story, leading to multiple endings based on the paths taken.

Quests will range from main storyline missions to side quests that explore the lore of the world and its inhabitants. Players will need to gather information, solve puzzles, and make strategic decisions that impact the flow of time and the fate of the world. With a rich narrative and engaging characters, "Chronic Echos" aims to provide an immersive RPG experience that combines nostalgia with innovative gameplay. Each era will have its own unique quests and challenges, encouraging players to explore and interact with the world in different ways.

Regular NPCs will provide background information, hints, and side quests, while key characters will drive the main plot forward. The story will be divided into chapters, each focusing on a different era and its significance to the overall narrative. Players will need to piece together clues from various timelines to uncover the truth behind the Chrono Crystal and the impending disaster. The game will feature memorable characters, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations, adding depth to the story and making the world feel alive. You will encounter allies who join your party, each bringing unique skills and perspectives to the journey.

Ultimately, "Chronic Echos" is a tale of courage, friendship, and the power of choice, set against the backdrop of a richly detailed world where time itself is a malleable force. It will challenge players to think creatively and strategically as they navigate the complexities of time and its impact on their adventure. Over the course of the game, players will uncover hidden secrets and lore that enrich the world and provide context for the events unfolding around them. Player choices will not only affect the immediate storyline but also have lasting repercussions on the world and its inhabitants, making each playthrough a unique experience.
