```uper Nintendo Entertainment System, built using pvsneslib.



## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Homebrew
- SNES emulator (SNES9x: `brew install --cask snes9x` or Mesen)

### Build the ROM
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd Chronic-Echo

# Install dependencies and build
make deps && make
```

### Test the ROM

```bash
# Test with Mesen emulator (installed by make deps)
make run

# Or open manually with SNES9x
open -a Snes9x build/ChronicEchos.sfc

# Or open manually with Mesen
open -a Mesen build/ChronicEchos.sfc

# Validate ROM integrity
./validate_rom.sh build/ChronicEchos.sfc
```

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated building and testing.

### CI Pipeline

- **Triggers**: Push and pull requests to `main` branch
- **Environment**: Ubuntu Linux with build tools
- **Build Process**:
  - Sets up pvsneslib environment
  - Compiles C code to 65816 assembly
  - Links and generates SNES ROM
  - Validates ROM integrity and size
- **Testing**: Attempts headless ROM testing with available emulators
- **Artifacts**: Built ROM and symbols uploaded for download

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem**: `make: *** No rule to make target 'cleanBuildRes'. Stop.`
**Solution**: This occurs when `PVSNESLIB_HOME` is not set correctly. Run `make deps` first to install pvsneslib, then `make`.

**Problem**: Build works in CI but fails locally
**Solution**: The Makefile was updated to use local paths instead of environment variables. Ensure you're using the latest Makefile from the repository.

**Problem**: Duplicate label warnings during linking
**Solution**: These warnings are expected with pvsneslib and harmless. The build will complete successfully.

### Emulator Issues

**Problem**: ROM doesn't load in emulator
**Solution**: Ensure you're using a compatible SNES emulator like SNES9x or Mesen. The ROM is built as LoROM format.

**Problem**: No sound or graphics
**Solution**: Check that your emulator settings are correct for SNES games. Try different video filters if graphics appear corrupted.

### Development Setup

**Problem**: Tools not found in PATH
**Solution**: Run `./setup_path.sh` after `make deps` to add pvsneslib tools to your PATH, or add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export PATH="/path/to/Chronic-Echo/pvsneslib/devkitsnes/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/path/to/Chronic-Echo/pvsneslib/devkitsnes/tools:$PATH"
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup Environment**: Run `make deps` to install pvsneslib and tools
2. **Edit Source**: Modify `src/main.c`, `src/sprites.c` and other source files
3. **Build**: Run `make` to compile C to assembly to ROM
4. **Test**: Run `make run` to test in emulator
5. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 2-4

## Toolchain

- **pvsneslib 4.3.0**: C library for SNES development
- **816-tcc**: C compiler targeting 65816 assembly
- **wla-65816**: 65816 assembler
- **wlalink**: ROM linker
- **SNES9x**: Emulator for testing

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 1: Engine Core** - Basic title screen working
âœ… **Phase 2.1: Input Integration** - Time manipulation controls implemented  
âœ… **Phase 2.2: Battle System Integration** - RPG combat with time mechanics

- Build pipeline established
- PPU initialization and text rendering
- Time manipulation system (rewind, slow motion, time stop)
- Player character system with RPG stats
- Comprehensive battle system with random encounters
- Time-based battle abilities (stop, slow, rewind)
- Battle UI with HP bars and action menus

ðŸ”„ **Next Steps: Phase 2.3 - World Building & Progression**

- Implement world map and navigation
- Add NPCs and dialogue system
- Create progression mechanics (leveling, equipment)
- Design multiple areas and dungeons
- Add save/load functionality
